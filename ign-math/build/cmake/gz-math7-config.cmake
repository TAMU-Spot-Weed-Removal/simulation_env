# - Config file for the gz-math7 package.
#
# For finding and loading gz-math7 from your project, type:
#
# find_package(gz-math7)
#
# This creates the following targets:
#
#   Core library target                     - gz-math7::gz-math7
#   Alternative target name                 - gz-math7::core
#   Core library + all requested components - gz-math7::requested
#
# Use target_link_libraries() to link your library or executable to one of the
# above targets.
#
# We also provide the following variables for backwards compatibility, but use
# of these is discouraged:
#
#   gz-math7_CORE_LIBRARY - Core library (actually contains gz-math7::core)
#   gz-math7_LIBRARIES    - All libraries to link against (actually contains gz-math7::requested).
#   gz-math7_INCLUDE_DIRS - Include directories for gz-math7 and its dependencies.
#
# We will also set gz-math7_FOUND to indicate that the package was found.
